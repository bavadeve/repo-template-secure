# Research Project Template (Secure & Reproducible)

This repository is based on a GitHub template designed for researchers. It helps you:

- Organize your analysis
- Protect sensitive data from being uploaded by accident
- Make your work easier to understand and repeat

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Add your scripts to the main folder and data files to `/data/`.

3. Commit your changes (data is ignored automatically):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial analysis script"
   git push
   ```

> Tip: If you’re working with others, you can create a new branch for your changes using:
> ```bash
> git checkout -b my-analysis
> ```

---

## Optional: Enable Pre-Commit Checks

You can install `pre-commit` to catch large files and formatting issues before you commit.

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This step is optional, but helpful!
