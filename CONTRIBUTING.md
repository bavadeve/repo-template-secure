# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering a contribution to this repository!

This project is structured for secure and reproducible research. Please follow the guidelines below to help maintain quality, transparency, and data protection.

## 🧠 What you can contribute

We welcome:
- Improvements to code or analysis scripts
- Documentation and reproducibility enhancements
- Suggestions for better data handling or security
- Bug fixes or test coverage additions

---

## 🧪 Reproducibility Practices

- Scripts should be **runnable end-to-end** without manual intervention
- For R:
  - Use `renv::snapshot()` to manage package environments
  - Use `here::here()` or `Sys.getenv()` instead of hardcoded paths
  - Include `sessionInfo()` in final scripts or notebooks
- For Python:
  - Use `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`
  - Avoid OS-specific paths; use `os.path` or `pathlib`
- Consider using Quarto or R Markdown for reproducible reporting

## 🔐 Security and Data Handling

We enforce a strict **no data** and **no secrets** in Git policy.

Do **not** commit:
- `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.RData`, `.sav`, `.json` data files
- Secrets, API keys, tokens, passwords
- Output files from private datasets

**Instead:**
- Add those file types to `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables or a separate config file (not tracked by git)
- Document how to access secure data in `README.md` (without revealing actual paths or content)

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for full policy.

- [ ] You added/updated `.gitignore` if needed
- [ ] You updated the README or relevant documentation
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows pass (no red ❌)
