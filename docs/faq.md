# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why can’t I upload my `.csv` file?

For privacy reasons, files like `.csv` are blocked from being uploaded automatically. You can still keep them locally in your `/data` folder, but GitHub won’t store them.

## What happens if I upload something I shouldn’t?

If you accidentally commit a file with sensitive information, contact your team lead or data steward. We’ll help clean up the history and make the repo safe again.

## Do I need to use all the files in this template?

Not necessarily. The template gives you a solid starting point. If something feels confusing or unnecessary, talk to other members of your team or contact Research Software Management.
