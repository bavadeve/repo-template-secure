# Frequently Asked Questions

## ðŸ’¬ Why canâ€™t I upload my `.csv` file?

For privacy reasons, files like `.csv` are blocked from being uploaded automatically. You can still keep them locally in your `/data` folder, but GitHub wonâ€™t store them.

## ðŸ’¬ What happens if I upload something I shouldnâ€™t?

If you accidentally commit a file with sensitive information, contact your team lead or data steward. Weâ€™ll help clean up the history and make the repo safe again.

## ðŸ’¬ Do I need to use all the files in this template?

Not necessarily. The template gives you a solid starting point. If something feels confusing or unnecessary, talk to other members of your team or contact Research Software Management.
