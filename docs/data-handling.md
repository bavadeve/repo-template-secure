# Working with Data in This Project

This folder is meant for any data files you use in your project â€” for example, `.csv` or `.xlsx` files.

## What to do

âœ… You can safely store your data files in the `/data/` folder.
âœ… You can describe what the data is and where it came from in `/data/README.md`.
âœ… If you have not changed the standard `.gitignore`, this folder is ignored by GitHub â€” the files inside it will not be uploaded.
âœ… Please check the `.gitignore` file to see what files (and folders) are blocked.

## What not to do

ðŸš« Do not add data files to other folders â€” they may be uploaded by accident.
ðŸš« Do not email your data â€” use your institutionâ€™s approved data sharing tools.

If you're not sure where to store something, it's always okay to ask your project lead or data steward.
