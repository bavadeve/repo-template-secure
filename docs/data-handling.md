# Working with Data in This Project

This folder is meant for any data files you use in your project — for example, `.csv` or `.xlsx` files.

## What to do

- ✅ You can safely store your data files in the `/data/` folder.
- ✅ You can describe what the data is and where it came from in `/data/README.md`.
- ✅ If you have not changed the standard `.gitignore`, this folder is ignored by GitHub — the files inside it will not be uploaded, except for the `README.md` file
- ✅ Please check the `.gitignore` file to see what files (and folders) are blocked.

## What not to do

- ⛔ Do not add data files to other folders — they may be uploaded by accident.
- ⛔ If you need to share data to others, do not email your data — use SURFfilesender or other approved data sharing tools.

If you're not sure where to store something, it's always okay to ask your project lead or data steward.
