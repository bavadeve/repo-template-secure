# Project Template Overview

This project is based on a GitHub template made to help researchers:

- Keep code and data organized
- Avoid accidentally uploading confidential files
- Make the project easier to repeat and understand later

You donâ€™t need to be a technical expert to use this. Just follow the folder structure, keep your data in the right place, and commit your scripts and notes as you go.
