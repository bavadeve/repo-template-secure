# How This Project Protects Your Data

This project uses automated checks to help keep your code and data safe.

These checks run automatically every time you push changes to GitHub:

- If you try to upload a file type that may contain sensitive data (like `.csv` or `.env`), GitHub will stop the upload and show a message
- If something goes wrong, GitHub will show a red ❌ and tell you why

These checks are meant to help — not punish you. If you hit an error and don’t understand it, just ask your project lead or team.
