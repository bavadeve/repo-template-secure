# Data Directory

This folder is intentionally left empty and is **ignored by Git** via `.gitignore`.

Place your data files here (e.g., `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.RData`).
Make sure they are not committed to the repository. Check the `.gitignore` file to see what files (and folders) are blocked.

You can document:
- Where the data came from
- File structure expected by scripts
- Links to secure storage (e.g., myDRE or institutional drives)
